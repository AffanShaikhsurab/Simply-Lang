Welcome to the **Simple** language project! Simple is a programming language crafted to make learning to code accessible and enjoyable for young learners. Its design emphasizes easy-to-understand syntax and natural language constructs.

## Overview

**Simple** provides a friendly introduction to programming by using natural language commands and straightforward syntax. It is designed to help children grasp fundamental programming concepts while having fun.

### Key Features

- **Intuitive Syntax**: Uses natural language to make coding easy for children.
- **Interactive Feedback**: Allows learners to see the results of their code instantly.
- **Educational Focus**: Aims to teach basic programming concepts in an engaging way.

## Installation Guide

### Prerequisites

- **Windows Operating System**: The installer is designed for Windows.
- **Administrative Rights**: Required to install the application and modify system environment variables.

### Installation Steps

1. **Download the Installer**

   Obtain the Simple Language (Simplylang) installer (`Simple.exe`) from the [official website](https://simplylang.org/) or your distribution channel.

2. **Run the Installer**

   - Double-click the `Simple.exe` file to start the installation process.
   - Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation. The installer will:
     - Install the Simple language executable and Python.
     - Set up necessary environment variables to run Simple from the command line.

3. **Verify Installation**

   - The installer will automatically add Simple to your system's PATH.
   - Open Command Prompt and type `simple` to ensure the executable is recognized and runs correctly.

### Example Usage

1. **Open Command Prompt**

   Press `Win + R`, type `cmd`, and press Enter to open Command Prompt.

2. **Run a Simple Script**

   Navigate to the directory where your `.simple` file is located or simply execute:

   ```bash
   simple example.simple
   ```

   Replace `example.simple` with the name of your Simple language file.

3. **Create and Run a Simple Script**

   Create a `.simple` file with the following content:

   ```simple
   a is 1
   b is a + 10
   show(b)
   ```

   Save the file as `example.simple` and run it using the command above to see the result.

## Project Goals

The Simple language project aims to:

- **Make Programming Accessible for Young Learners**: By using natural language constructs, Simple helps children understand and write code more easily.
  
- **Promote Early Learning**: Designed to be engaging and interactive, Simple encourages children to explore and learn programming concepts through hands-on experience.

- **Develop Computational Thinking**: Introduces programming logic and problem-solving in a way that is approachable and fun.

- **Create an Intuitive Development Environment**: With its easy-to-read syntax and immediate feedback, Simple aims to provide a supportive learning environment.
